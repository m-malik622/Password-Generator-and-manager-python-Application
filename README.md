# Password-Generator-and-manager-python-Application
An application that can create a password n characters long. Creates a .xlsx file to store passwords.


#How to Install
This is a single file application that would only require the tkinter and openpyxl libraries for python 3.0
 Item 1
- Tkinter pip install command
  - pip install tk
- Openpyxl
  - pip install openpyxl
Since the application handles only .xlsx files, it is recomended to have a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet account. If not, you can use a .xlsx viewer that would allow you to view the file, but not edit it. If you would wish to edit the file, and you do not have Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet, the program allows you to change the contents.

#Future changes
1.A cleaner ui
2.An option to display the password in the terminal without needing to create an xlsx file
